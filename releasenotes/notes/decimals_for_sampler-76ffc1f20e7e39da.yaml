    The :class:`~.Sampler` used to round quasi-probability values to 16 decimal positions. That rounding parameter was changed to 15.
    This might slightly change the primitive output with respect to previous versions. The change have an amplified impact in some algorithms context,
    like in QAOA, affecting the number of iterations and, potentially, their result.
