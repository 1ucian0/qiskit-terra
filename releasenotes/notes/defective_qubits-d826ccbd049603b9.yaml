    The `transpile` function supports backends with defective qubits or gates. If a gate/qubit parameter backend
    property called ``operational`` exists  and it is ``False``, the transpiler will considered the maximun connected
    subgraph of qubits as a coulpling map and handle the process to avoid using non-operation qubits/gates.
