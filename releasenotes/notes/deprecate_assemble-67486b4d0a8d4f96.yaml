    The structures related to Qobj are now deprecated. Interacting with remote backends should be done via QPY or
    OpenQASM instead.
deprecations_transpiler:
  - |
    The function `assemble` is now deprecated as the Qobj structure is not needed any more. The function was used,
    among other things, to create a Qobj. It was also used for binding parameter and that functionality is now
    fully covered by :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`.
