    BackendV1 is deprecated and it will be removed not earlier than the next major release.
    If providers want to explose a backend only as a hardware description, consider constructing a :class:`.Target`.
    If the provider also provides access for execution, that can be done via the primitives interfaces.
    Alternatebly, if the previous model is prefered, consider moving to :class:`.BackendV2` (see https://ibm.biz/qiskit_backendv1-to-v2).
