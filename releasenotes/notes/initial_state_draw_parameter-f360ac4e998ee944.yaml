    The circuit ``draw`` method has a new boolean `initial_state` parameter for optinally including the initial state in the drawing.
    ...python
	circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
	circuit.measure_all()
	circuit.draw(inital_state=False)
    ...
	            ░ ┌─┐
	      q_0: ─░─┤M├───
	            ░ └╥┘┌─┐
	      q_1: ─░──╫─┤M├
	            ░  ║ └╥┘
	measure_0: ════╩══╬═
	                  ║
	measure_1: ═══════╩═

     ...python
	circuit.draw(initial_value=True)

     ....
	              ░ ┌─┐
	     q_0: |0>─░─┤M├───
	              ░ └╥┘┌─┐
	     q_1: |0>─░──╫─┤M├
	              ░  ║ └╥┘
	measure_0: 0 ════╩══╬═
	                    ║
	measure_1: 0 ═══════╩═

    Because the default is `False`, this change might differ from previous behavior for ascii and latex drawers.
