    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw`
    and :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function will no longer include the initial state
    included in visualizations by default. If you would like to retain the initial state in the output
    visualization you need to set the ``initial_state`` kwarg to ``True``. For example, running:
    ...python
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
    circuit.measure_all()
    circuit.draw(inital_state=False)
    ...
                ░ ┌─┐
          q_0: ─░─┤M├───
                ░ └╥┘┌─┐
          q_1: ─░──╫─┤M├
                ░  ║ └╥┘
    measure_0: ════╩══╬═
                      ║
    measure_1: ═══════╩═

     ...python
    circuit.draw(initial_state=True)

     ....
                  ░ ┌─┐
         q_0: |0>─░─┤M├───
                  ░ └╥┘┌─┐
         q_1: |0>─░──╫─┤M├
                  ░  ║ └╥┘
    measure_0: 0 ════╩══╬═
                        ║
    measure_1: 0 ═══════╩═

    Because the default is `False`, this change might differ from previous behavior for ascii and latex drawers.
