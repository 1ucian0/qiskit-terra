deprecations:
  - |
    The use of `numpy.ndarray` as a parameter type for the class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate` is being deprecated.
    If your custom gates takes a unitary matrix as a parameter, consider instantiating
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate`. Otherwise, you might have to create your
    own :class:`~qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate` subclass and implement
    `validate_parameter` method accordingly.  
  - |
    The class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.instruction.Instruction` should be consider
    abstract and it should not be instantiated directly.
